It\u2019s the perfect way to take a household staple like 7UP and make it feel a little more fancy. Whether you\u2019re making it for a mocktail-loving crowd or the kids in the crowd, it\u2019s one very simple recipe that should always be in your go-to stack.","tips":"Where did the name Shirley Temple come from? The drink was named after iconic child actress Shirley Temple. Legend has it that when she was out to dinner at a nice restaurant with her parents and other Hollywood types who were all enjoying cocktails, the bartender made her a special nonalcoholic drink so she could feel fancy too. Instead of 7UP, the Shirley Temple recipe can also be made with Canada Dry\u00ae Ginger Ale.","partnership":0,"prep_time":"","cook_time":"","ready_in":"2 minutes","serving_size":"1 person","description":"Mix up Shirley Temple, made with 7UP\u00ae, today.","glasstype":"highball","over21":0,"video":"","video_alt_text":"","featured_video":"","featured_video_alt_text":"","related_recipes_title":"Birthday","related_recipes":"ginger-peach-soda,7up-cherry-melonade","meta_title":"Shirley Temple Recipe | 7UP\u00ae","meta_description":"Mix up Shirley Temple, made with 7UP\u00ae, today.","og_title":"Shirley Temple Recipe | 7UP\u00ae","og_description":"Mix up Shirley Temple, made with 7UP\u00ae, today.","image_alt":"shirley temple drink recipe","content_visitor":"mixer","recipe_cat":"non_alcoholic, drinks","udo_ingredients":"","programs":"","bartender":1,"bartender_order":17,"bartender_related_recipes":"cherry-limeade,7up-cherry-vanilla,the-selector","bartender_ingredients":["0|7UP\u00ae or Diet 7UP\u00ae|72.7%|#00c785|soda-light|0.4|#005236","0|Grenadine Syrup|27.3%|#f46e6e|flavor-additive|0.2|#692828"],"bartender_icon":1},{"name":"Watermelon Fresca","slug":"watermelon-fresca","order":2,"hidden":0,"type":"drink","occasions":"dinner-party,brunch,backyard-party,girls-night","mixingredients":"tequila,fruit-juice","product":"7up","ingredients":"1-1\/2 oz. silver tequila|\r 3\/4 oz. orange liqueur|\r 4 one-inch seedless watermelon cubes, for garnish|\r 1-1\/2 oz. 7UP\u00ae| Ice","directions":"In a cocktail shaker, muddle three watermelon cubes. | Add the tequila, orange liqueur, and ice cubes. | Strain and pour into a cocktail glass. | Add 1-1\/2 oz. of 7UP\u00ae, top with ice, and stir. | Garnish with remaining watermelon cube.","intro":"Everyone loves watermelon. And is there anything more summery than a cool watermelon drink on a warm day? How about drinking a fresh watermelon cocktail on the porch on a warm day? Poured over ice cubes? Just a little watermelon goes a long way when muddled and mixed with tequila, orange liqueur, and 7UP in this crisp, mildly sweet cocktail. It\u2019s the delicious adult version of an agua fresca.","tips":"Orange liqueur comes in a variety of brands, goes by a few different names, and isn\u2019t always orange. In general, it\u2019s just a sweetened alcohol with orange flavoring. Try different varieties, and you\u2019ll start to taste their differences: mild orange flavor, strong orange flavor, hints of spice, sweet, or even a \u201cdry\u201d version.","partnership":0,"prep_time":"","cook_time":"","ready_in":"4 minutes","serving_size":"1 person","description":"Try a refreshing Watermelon Fresca made with 7UP\u00ae.

And like everything else, they\u2019re making a comeback. We\u2019re putting a twist on this 7UP sherbet punch recipe, giving it an apple pie flavor. To make it kid-friendly, just omit the vodka.","tips":"Sure, you can pour everything in a bowl and let guests serve themselves. No fuss, no worry. But if you\u2019d like to fancy up your 7UP sherbet punch, layer other colorful garnishes on the top or put a fresh sherbet scoop into glasses after they\u2019re filled.","partnership":0,"prep_time":"","cook_time":"","ready_in":"10 minutes","serving_size":"25 people","description":"Mix up 7UP Apple Pie Punch, made with 7UP\u00ae, today.

Rum begins as a clear spirit (white rum). As it\u2019s aged in barrels, it turns darker and takes on bolder flavors. The longer it\u2019s aged, the darker it gets. This recipe lets you experience three types of rum!","tips":"A garnish is the perfect way to take a cocktail from basic to beautiful. Garnish the Rum Rambler with a pineapple slice, maraschino cherries, or a citrus twist. Or go big and add all three to a cocktail garnish skewer. Serve on warm days, and whisk yourself away to a tropical island.","partnership":0,"prep_time":"","cook_time":"","ready_in":"3 minutes","serving_size":"1 person","description":"Mix up 7UP Rum Rambler, made with 7UP\u00ae, today.

Don\u2019t forget to start with a glass rimmed in sprinkles before you add ice and start pouring! The sprinkle-covered rim practically guarantees your friends will share a photo of it (the ultimate compliment, right?).","tips":"You could garnish this with a simple orange wedge or wheel. Or try your hand at making a garnish twist. Start with a wheel of orange. Cut into one side of the wheel, which will slice the rind. Remove the fleshy fruit wheel so all that remains is the strip of rind. Twist it \u2013 around your finger, a straw, or other object, and voil\u00e0!","partnership":0,"prep_time":"","cook_time":"","ready_in":"2 minutes","serving_size":"1 person","description":"Mix up 7UP Side-Down Cake, made with 7UP\u00ae, today.

And, yes, it will be just as delicious if you make it in July.","tips":"Curious about Oloroso sherry? Sherry is a type of wine that comes from Spain. It\u2019s made from Palomino grapes that are fermented over different time periods, and it\u2019s often mixed (fortified) with grape spirits, producing a more intense flavor and higher alcohol content than traditional wine. Oloroso sherry is slightly higher in alcohol content and is a darker color, due in part to its longer aging process. Sherry wine is often enjoyed as an aperitif or dessert wine.","partnership":0,"prep_time":"","cook_time":"","ready_in":"5 minutes","serving_size":"1 person","description":"Warm your spirits with a By the Fire cocktail, made with the classics, scotch and sherry, and brightened and lightened with simple syrup and 7UP\u00ae.
